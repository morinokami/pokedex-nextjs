## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To open the app using your phone, run the server with the following command:

```bash
$ npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0
```

Now you can access the server from your phone on the same network.
